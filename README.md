# Reddit Scraper Bot
This is a bot that gets the top 10 'Hottest' posts from a specific [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com) (Forms).  These posts are then reposted onto a [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) account.  

Both the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) will be used. The Reddit API for retrieving posts and titles, and the Twitter API for posting (reposting). 

  
## Future plans

Currently the posts are only posting to Twitter. As of 2021 [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) has released in a [blog post](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/26/introducing-instagram-content-publishing-api/) that there is a content publishing API being released for business accounts. There are current workarounds to post directly to an account. For this project I wanted to consume as many public APIs as possible.
